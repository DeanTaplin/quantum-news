- **Quantum computing ‘KPIs’ could distinguish true breakthroughs from spurious claims**
  - Using a range of metrics could ... quantum computers, as well as interoperability, says Whitfield. Each type of qubit has its own strengths, and sometimes companies report only the metrics that suit them. “It’s almost like they don’t want you to compare across devices,” Whitfield says. The Quantum Advantage Tracker aims to help compare ...
